       The goal of the game is simple: You are given a random word that you must guess. To preform a guess you enter a letter, and that letter is filled in for the word. If you guess a letter incorrectly you use an attempt. If you use all 5 of your attempts before guessing the word, its a game over. If you successfully guess the full word in under 5 attempts, you win!
